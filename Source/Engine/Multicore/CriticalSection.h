 Description
      
       helper class
 
 
       allows automatic Locking/ Unlocking of a Resource,
       protected by a Critical Section:
       - locking when this object gets constructed
       - unlocking when this object is destructed
        (goes out of scope)
 
 
 Usage
 
 
       when you need protected access to a resource, do the following
       1. Create a Critical Section associated with the resource
       2. Embody the code accessing the resource in braces {}
       3. Construct an ScopedCriticalSection object
 
 
  Example:
       // we assume that m_CriticalSection
       // is a private variable, and we use it to protect
       // 'this' from being accessed while we need safe access to a resource
      
 
 
       // code that does not need resource locking
      
       {
              ScopedCriticalSection I_am_locked( m_cs);
             
              // code that needs thread locking
       }
      
       // code that does not need resource locking
